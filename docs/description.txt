Data Source:
The project will utilize the COVID-19 dataset available on the "Our World in Data" website (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). This comprehensive dataset includes various metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, testing, hospitalizations, vaccinations, policy responses, and more, for 207 countries over the course of the pandemic. Cases, deaths, and vaccinations are recorded on a daily level.

Project Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to build a data analysis workflow/s for the COVID-19 dataset.
The research goal is to investigate the following 3 main points:
1. Understand how the number of cases and deaths differ across continents on a yearly level.
2. Explore the influence of factors such as life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population density on the number of cases and deaths. Given one of the just mentioned factors, compare the average number of cases/deaths between countries with values of the factor above the median and those with values below the median.
3. Explore the relationship between deaths, cases and vaccinations. Are deaths and vaccinations correlated? How did all these metrics evolve in time? 
For point 3., due to missing values reasons, we restrict the analysis to Europe.

The workflows:
Given the research aim of the project, we have thought about implementing 3 workflows, each targeting one of the research questions.
All the workflows have configurable parameters that allow to get insights on different declinations of the research points. For additional and detailed information see the readme and the requirements.md files.


Workflow 1: Exploring Correlations Between Categorical Variables and COVID-19 Metrics

This workflow involves using the Mann-Whitney U test to identify correlations between categorical variables and COVID-19 metrics like cases or deaths.

1. Process the data to create a dataset with relevant categorical variables (e.g., country income level, population density, etc.) and COVID-19 metrics.
2. Apply the Mann-Whitney U test to each categorical variable, comparing the COVID-19 metric values between the different categories.
3. For categorical variables with p-values below 0.05, create box plots to visualize the difference in the COVID-19 metric between the categories.
4. For categorical variables with p-values above 0.05, create line plots to show the trend in the COVID-19 metric over time, broken down by different categories.
5. Analyze the results to identify any significant relationships between the categorical variables and the COVID-19 metrics.
