The project aims at implementing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow based on the dataset Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases. 
The analysis focuses on the following five research questions:

1) In which continent were the highest number of cases and deaths recorded?
2) Has the implementation of hand washing facilities helped to reduce the number of total cases?
3) Restricting to Germany, how is the number of deaths related to number of people vaccinated?
4) Are the total number of deaths and life expectancy correlated?
5) How does the population density affect the total number of cases (country level)
